Hi Tyson, since you're going to be handling the web layout, I've ceated this branch for you to push to.
As our content is generated either me or you can add it in as we go.

If you could keep a log of you changes here that would be great. Git has a push history but having the changelog fleshed
out a bit will help with our final submission, versioning might help too. I don't know if i'm teaching you how to suck 
eggs here but you can turn on e-mail notifications for pushes under the repo settings. 

Anyone else who's reading this as part of the team the above applys!
