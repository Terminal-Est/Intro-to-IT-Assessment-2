        Peak Performance is a group of five hard working individuals juggling their busy adult lives, with everyone over 30 years old, with their Information Technology studies at RMIT. They have all decided to broaden their horizons and expand their skills in IT in order to look for new and better working opportunities in areas as diverse as cyber forensics, artificial intelligence, penetration testing, server administration and user experience. The team is located in and around Perth, Western Australia and Melbourne, Victoria. Even with the vast space between each other, even those who live in the same city having limited time to meet in person due to work and family commitments, they have come to become a cohesive team that can get things done.

      <p>
        The team is in constant communication via Facebook Messenger and has a weekly meeting on Friday afternoons in order to keep informed about what the others in the group are doing in regards to the current report. The other online collaboration tools they use to collaborate together including Canvas <abbr title="Learning Management System">LMS</abbr>, Zoom online conferencing system, Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Sharepoint, Facebook Messenger and other ad hoc apps as needed.

        As team Peak Performance are finishing the current report the current report they have already started making plans for the next project where they will design, document and develop part of a home automation system. This includes ordering parts in order to prototype the project, although Christopher and Tyson already have been playing with Arduino micro-controllers in a hobby capacity for a little while already. They are looking forward to being able to continue to work together and hope to build a functioning prototype even though they are in two locations. They will be taking their collaborative efforts to a new level in the next assignment looking into new and better ways of keeping in up to date and keeping track of tasks by using <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank" title="Link to Trello website (opens in a new window)">Trello</a> a project management tool. This will make it much easier to give group feedback as all the tasks will have owners and a history of completion.
